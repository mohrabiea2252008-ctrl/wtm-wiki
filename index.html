    play: `Playstyle (Long): The M4A1 is a versatile early-medium that rewards measured aggression and positioning. At Tier I it functions as a reliable backbone of a platoon — not the fastest flanker but stable and flexible. Start engagements by taking medium-range positions supporting light scouts: your 75 mm gun can reliably punch through most early Tier I light and medium tanks' sides. Use hull-down where terrain permits — the Sherman’s turret and sloped upper front are more survivable if you expose only the turret. When flanking, target the side and rear plates; use APHE for internal module damage (engine, ammo) when facing angled armor. Avoid exposing broadside to high-velocity enemy TDs; instead, bait shots and punish their lower plates and rear. In city maps, use building corners to peek and quickly reposition — Shermans excel in short, accurate bursts. Equip repairs and optics if available, since maintaining mobility and situational awareness is critical. In platoon play, act as the second-line: take initial hits for lighter scouts and trade with similarly tiered opponents. Remember that the M4A1 is not invulnerable — choose angles and keep moving after each shot to reduce return-fire risk.`,
    howToKill: `How to Kill the M4A1:
- Shoot the turret cupola or the mantlet from a flanking position to cause crew or module damage.
- Aim for the lower glacis or track area to immobilize; once tracked, finish with a side shot to the hull or engine deck.
- APHE rounds work best to start fires or detonate ammo racks when you can't overmatch armor.
- Use HE rounds at very close range to disable modules if AP penetration is marginal.`,

    play: `Playstyle (Long): The M10 Wolverine is a classic ambush TD: use concealment, long sightlines, and your gun's high muzzle velocity to snipe enemy medium tanks and support pushes. At Tier I you can out-range most light tanks; look for hull-down ridgelines and choke points where you can fire at the flank or rear as enemies cross. Never expose your open turret directly to enemy fire—this vehicle's survivability depends almost entirely on angling and distance. When flanking, engage from the side and aim for engine decks, fuel tanks, or the lower hull to immobilize. If forced into close combat, dodge and relocate—your armor doesn't withstand direct hits. In team play, pair with a mobile light tank (Chaffee) to spot while you deliver high-delta-velocity hits. Use smoke if you must cross open ground, and avoid arching shots that expose your deck to high-angle fire.`,

- Force it to reposition by pressuring its flanks; then close distance and attack its weak hull sides.
- HE and arty are very effective against the open-top turret—aim for the deck or crew compartment.

Use hull-down peeks on ridges and take carefully aimed shots at exposed sides and rears — aim for tracks to immobilize priority targets. In urban maps, use alleyways and flank lanes to ambush medium tanks by hitting engine decks or side plates. Avoid head-on fights with guns that outrange you; when pressured, use your superior mobility to disengage and relocate. In squad play, act as the eyes of the team and cap contestor. Equip modules that increase view range and engine repair to maximize uptime. If you score a shot on a medium, don't linger—relocate to avoid return fire or enemy TD flanks.`,

Use it to protect cap points and forward scouts from strafing aircraft while providing light ground support against unarmored or lightly armored vehicles. Position it just behind a ridge or in flanking bushes where its .50 cals can see the sky and the immediate ground around caps. Against ground targets, use concentrated bursts aimed at external modules (radiators, ammo racks) — the sustained fire can shred crew and start fires on exposed engine decks of light tanks and armored cars. Avoid fighting heavy frontal engagements; if enemy tanks get close, relocate or hide behind a sturdy teammate. In coordinated teams, your presence forces enemy pilots to be cautious and enables freer movement for your medium and heavy tanks.`,

- It is fragile — any decent AP shell will kill it. Approach from flank and use high-penetration rounds.
